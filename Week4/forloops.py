# Write a Python Program that does each of the following:

# Given the following list of items (copy and paste this line into your program):

colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]

# Use a for loop to iterate through this list one by one and display each item on its own line

for color in colors:
    print(color)

# Use a for loop to display the numbers 1–8, one number on each line

for number in range(1, 9):
    print(number)

# Use a for loop to display the even numbers (hint: count by two) 2–20, one number on each line

for number in range(2, 21, 2):
    print(number)
